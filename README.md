# yts-lists
Download torrents from YTS using their V2 API

## Requirements
1. Python 3.x (tested on 3.8) for getting download list of torrents
2. requests (pip3 install requests)
3. nested-lookup (pip3 install nested-lookup)

## Steps
1. Run main.py to generate \*.torrent files

## TODO
+ ~~Use cross platform alternative to Wget (or implement Invoke-WebRequest for powershell)~~
+ Add user input options for preferred file type
+ Better file naming system, rather than relying on Hash of torrent file.
+ Enhance performance if possible (file I/O may cause performance degradation?)
+ Show better progress meters
+ Implement Command line scripting for automation
+ Optimize imports?
+ Remove Unnecessary code
